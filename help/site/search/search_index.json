Use Once Agent This agent lets you set item(s) in your backpack to be used via a hotkey. Once the item is used, it is removed from the list. This is very useful for for trapped pouches. Add all your trapped pouches to the list and use them on the run. The list will remove each one as it's popped, and warn you when your list is empty. Add (Target) Use this option to add items, one at a time. Add Container (Target) Use this option to add the contents of an entire bag. Open the bag before targeting so Razor can 'see' the contents. This is the best option for adding multiple trapped pouches with the Use Once Agent . Keep them inside another bag and add the bag. Remove (Target) Remove items from the list. This option gives a cursor target. Target the item to be removed. Clear List Clears all items from the list. Sell Agent Items on this list sell automatically to vendors when you begin a sale transaction (you must still be at the appropiate vendor). Choose how many to sell each time; a great tool for BOD collection. The listing is done by item type, not item ID. If you have a magic longsword and a player-made longsword in your pack, adding longsword would result in both being sold. If you add plate armor to the list, the agent will attempt to sell all plate armor, colored or not, magic or not. The list can be disable without being cleared. Add (Target) Click for a targeting cursor, target the item to add. Remove Highlight an item in the list and click remove to delete it. Set Hot Bag Razor will attempt to sell all items in a specified bag. Clear Clear the list Max Sell Select how many of each item to sell. Each item must be sold to the appropriate vendor. The vendor must have sufficient gold to buy the item. When you are selling you may note a discrepancy between the razor messages, gold received and the vendor replies. Razor will try to sell all items that can be sold to the vendor you are at, and the total it gives is for all those items combined. If the vendor cannot purchase all the items, the amount actually received will be less the the total stated by Razor. This does not mean you have been ripped off, only that the vendor couldn't buy everything. Continue on to the next vendor of the same type to continue selling. (Push to Disable/Enable) Turn the sell agent on or off. Organizer Agent This agent is used to move items from one container to another. For example, if I purchase 20 mortar and pestle for my alchemist, I can easily bag them all without having to click and drag each one individually. If I click 20 potions from kegs and want them in my pvp supply bag, it can be done quickly without accidentally using one, without all the click and drag. There are 10 different organizers so there is room to set and keep frequently used lists. Hot keys will allow you to use the organizer and reset the target bag organized to. Add (Target) Use this option to add items. Set Hot Bag Set the hot bag to organize the items to. When it is already set, the tab changes to say 'Clear Hot Bag'. Both give a targeting cursor. Organize Now Once everything is set, click this tab to activate the organizer. Remove Highlight an item and click this tab to remove the item from the list. Clear Clear the organizer; it can now be reset. Stop Now Stops the organizer mid-process. Scavenger Agent This agent is for automatically picking up items off the ground that are in range. Very useful, for example, during an IDOC. Add (Target) Click for a targeting cursor, target the item to add. Remove Highlight an item in the list and click remove to delete it. Set Hot Bag Razor will put all items scavenged into this bag. If not bag is set, it will go into your main backpack. Clear Clear the list. Clear Scavenger Cache Razor will only try to pick up an item once, and move on. If Razor missed some items on the ground, click this button so it will try again. (Push to Disable/Enable) Turn the scavenger agent on or off. Buy Agent The buy agent is for setting lists of items to buy at vendors. Used for purchasing large quantities or multiple items. Remember to check vendor prices each time Before enabling and using this agent. Use with caution, it is possible for the vendors to have items listed incorrectly. This will cause an erroneous purchase for you. Add (Target) Target the item to be added to the list. A second gump (see below) prompts you to enter the amount to be purchased. Edit Highlight any item in the list and click Edit to change the amount to purchase. A gump prompts you to enter the amount. Remove Highlight any item and click Remove to delete it from the list. Clear List Clear the entire list. (Push to Disable/Enable) Use this tab to turn the agent off and on. Each buy agent can be set separately. Restock Agent The Restock agent is used to drag items from a container to be placed inside your backpack. Setting this up will enable you to restock your character at the click of a key. The restock agent will only stock up to the amount you indicate, not simply add the amounts to what you already have. For example, my restock agent is set to include 33 black pearl. When I use the restock agent, it will top my black pearl up to 33; it won't add 33 more. Add (Target) Target the item to be added to the list. A second gump (see below) prompts you to enter the amount to be purchased. Remove Highlight any item and click Remove to delete it from the list. Set Amount Highlight any item in the list and click Set Amount to change the restock amount. A gump prompts you to enter the amount: Clear List Clear the entire list. Clear Hot Bag Use this tab to set the hotbag to restock too. If no bag is indicated, Razor restocks to your main backpack. Restock Now Activate the agent. You will receive a targeting cursor. Target the container to restock from. If you are at the bank, with your bank open, you can target your character to refill from the bank. This may also be set as a hotkey. IgnoreList Agent Players added to this list will have all the say, yell, emote, etc blocked. Spell power words will still be seen. Add (Target) Target the character to be added to the list. Remove Highlight any name and click Remove to delete it from the list. Remove (Target) Gives a targeting cursor. Target the player to remove from the list. Clear List Clear the entire list.

Note When using ClassicUO, some features in Razor are disabled since they either won't work with ClassicUO or cause conflicts. Installing Razor (ClassicUO) Create a new folder on your local computer (ie: C:\\Games\\ClassicUO ) Open PowerShell prompt and go to folder you created Execute the following PowerShell command Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString( 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/markdwags/Razor/master/InstallClassicUOAndRazor-NoDefaults.ps1')) Warning If you are on an older version of Windows, you may experience issues running this command. You can get the latest version here . Follow the on-screen prompts to set up the ClassicUO settings.json file first the first time. To avoid duplicating documentation, you can find more details here . Installing Razor (OSI Client) First, download Razor . Unlike previous versions of Razor, this version doesn't use the Windows Registry or %AppData%\\Razor to store configuration, macros and profiles. In other words, it's portable . To install, follow these simple steps: Download the latest release of Razor at the main site . Extract the zip into any location (ie: C:\\UO\\Razor ) (Optional) If you have an existing version of Razor, copy the Profiles and Macros folders from %AppData%\\Razor into the folder you extracted the zip above to. If you have custom counters, also copy counters.xml over. Warning All macros should work from previous version, with the exception of macros using targeting created in Razor 1.0.14.x. You will need to re-add those target hotkeys to your macros. Right-click on the Razor shortcut or Razor.exe, go to Properties. On the Compatibility tab, select Run this program in compatibility mode for and select Windows XP SP2 . Also select Run this program as an administrator Run Razor either via the shortcut or clicking the Razor.exe directly. Razor should prompt to Run As Administrator . You must allow this for Razor to function correctly. Upgrading Razor Since Razor is portable, upgrading it is a copy/paste exercise. Download the latest release of Razor at the main site . Extract the zip into your existing Razor location (ie: C:\\UO\\Razor ), overwritting all files, with the exception of two: counters.xml - This is the default counters file used to display items in your titlebar. If you've added any new counters, they would be lost if overwritten. Razor.exe.Config - This is the config file that stores your UO path, server list, etc. Copying this over will overwrite those settings. Open Razor back up and log back in.

Record a set of actions often repeated. The macro can then be run repeatedly to copy the same actions. In this manner, less wear and tear is put on your mouse. Macros can be used to macro skill, even afk or while playing another character. Macros can be used for gathering resources and crafting. Macros are divided into two sections. The column on the left is the macro index of all macros you make. On the right is the action area, used to set and edit the macros you create. Macros are saved to a folder, 'Macros', in your Razor folder. These can be edited in text format. Macros Categories Categories can be created to organize your macros into groups. While, unlike the rest of the profile, macros are shared across all characters. Each character can have their own hot key settings depending on how frequent that character would use the macro (if at all). Right click the left column for the following options: Add Category Add a category to place macros in. A gump will prompt you to enter a name. Delete Category Highlight a category and click delete to remove it. Macros inside the category will need to be removed first. Move to Category Move macros to the category you choose. Refresh Macro List Update changes made to the list. Creating a macro To Create a Macro, begin by clicking the 'New' tab at the bottom of the gump. A second gump prompts you to enter the name of the macro; click 'OK'. The macro will now appear in the left index. Highlight the macro name with a left click. A list of functions to set the macro will now show beside the right action window. Right click the macro name to move it into a category if you choose. Set/Recording a macro To Set/Record a Macro, highlight the macro in the left index. Click the 'Record' tab on the right and go through the actions in-game that you want in the macro. When you have finished, click the 'Stop' tab. Once the macro is created, the 'Stop' tab will change to a 'Play' tab when the macro is not running. To clear the macro entirely for re-recording, click the Record tab again. A prompt warns your original macro will be cleared. You now have the basis of a macro. From here, you can fine tune it with a list of options found with a right-click. Reload Update Razor folder changes without closing Razor. This option will applies to the entire Razor folder, not specific macros. If you have edited a macro in text format, or added a a pre-made macro to the folder that isn't showing up, use this option. Save Saves changes made to Razor in the text file without closing the program. Move Up/Down Highlight a line and move it up or down with these two commands. Useful for changing text placement, misplaced commands, and more. Tip: If you hold down CTRL-ALT and use the UP and DOWN keys. Remove Action Highlight a line and click this option to delete the action from the macro. This cannot be recovered except by re-recording the action. Begin Recording Here Use this option to add actions you have missed. Razor will begin recording in the current macro. The action(s) will appear after the line highlighted. Play from Here Play the macro from the line indicated. Useful for checking macros as you set them. Special Constructs Pause/Wait This option gives a second gump of choices. A pause can be entered based on a specific amount of time. Waits can be added for gumps, targets, and old-style menus. Waits can also be added based on hitpoints, mana, or dexterity reaching a specified amount. For example: Wait for Mana <= 90 Set Last Target Gives a cursor to set a new last target. Comment Does not actually appear in the macro. This is for user notes and comments. \"If\" Conditional Set a command depending on circumstances - If mana is <= ; If black pearl => \"Else\" You can continue the \"if\" conditional by adding 'else'. For example: If black pearl is <= 32 Use restock agent 5 Else If black pearl is => 33 Use organizer agent 5 End if This would tell razor to restock with restock agent 5 if black pearl if it is equal to or less than 32, use organizer agent 5 if black pearl is equal to or greater than 33. \"End If\" Use this line to end your 'if' commands. This tells Razor this part of the macro is complete. \"For Loop\" A command to loop (repeat) all actions following. A gump appears with this option, enter the number of times to repeat. \"End For\" Use this when actions to be looped have ended. This line tells razor the \"for Loop\" part of the macro has ended. Options This version of Razor has an expanded section with additional macro options Absolute Target Variables The concept with Absolute Target Variables is to remove duplicate macros for the same thing. For example, you have a Recall macro that casts recall, waits for target, and clicks a rune or runebook. If you have 5 characters doing the same thing, you need 5 macros because the unique ID of the rune or runebook is different. With Absolute Target Variables in that same scenario, you can have one macro cover all 5 characters. Your macro and absolute target variable might look like this: As long as you have setup a $rune variable on your profile, that macro will work across all profiles. Add This will give you a target in game to select the item to create a variable based on Insert This will insert the currently selected variable into the selected macro. Retarget If you need to update the variable to a new item, use this. Remove Remove the selected variable from the list. Options Force different 'TargetByType' Prevents a macro from selecting the same item over and over (for example, the item is out of range) Range check on 'TargetByType' Macros will only target items by type that are in range of your character. This is to prevent a macro from trying to target an item out of range. Range check on 'DoubleClickType' Same idea here. Macros will only double-click items in range of your character. Step Through Macro If checked, each step in the macro will require you to click Next . Useful for debugging your macros. Default macro action delay (50ms) The OSI client required a 50ms delay, which isn't required by ClassicUO. Some macros were designed with ths 50ms delay in mind. Checking this and restarting Razor will restore it.

Reload Update Razor folder changes without closing Razor. This option will applies to the entire Razor folder, not specific macros. If you have edited a macro in text format, or added a a pre-made macro to the folder that isn't showing up, use this option. Save Saves changes made to Razor in the text file without closing the program. Move Up/Down Highlight a line and move it up or down with these two commands. Useful for changing text placement, misplaced commands, and more. Tip: If you hold down CTRL-ALT and use the UP and DOWN keys. Remove Action Highlight a line and click this option to delete the action from the macro. This cannot be recovered except by re-recording the action. Begin Recording Here Use this option to add actions you have missed. Razor will begin recording in the current macro. The action(s) will appear after the line highlighted. Play from Here Play the macro from the line indicated. Useful for checking macros as you set them. Special Constructs Pause/Wait This option gives a second gump of choices. A pause can be entered based on a specific amount of time. Waits can be added for gumps, targets, and old-style menus. Waits can also be added based on hitpoints, mana, or dexterity reaching a specified amount. For example: Wait for Mana <= 90 Set Last Target Gives a cursor to set a new last target. Comment Does not actually appear in the macro. This is for user notes and comments. \"If\" Conditional Set a command depending on circumstances - If mana is <= ; If black pearl => \"Else\" You can continue the \"if\" conditional by adding 'else'. For example: If black pearl is <= 32 Use restock agent 5 Else If black pearl is => 33 Use organizer agent 5 End if This would tell razor to restock with restock agent 5 if black pearl if it is equal to or less than 32, use organizer agent 5 if black pearl is equal to or greater than 33. \"End If\" Use this line to end your 'if' commands. This tells Razor this part of the macro is complete. \"For Loop\" A command to loop (repeat) all actions following. A gump appears with this option, enter the number of times to repeat. \"End For\" Use this when actions to be looped have ended.

For example, you have a Recall macro that casts recall, waits for target, and clicks a rune or runebook. If you have 5 characters doing the same thing, you need 5 macros because the unique ID of the rune or runebook is different. With Absolute Target Variables in that same scenario, you can have one macro cover all 5 characters. Your macro and absolute target variable might look like this: As long as you have setup a $rune variable on your profile, that macro will work across all profiles. Add This will give you a target in game to select the item to create a variable based on Insert This will insert the currently selected variable into the selected macro.

This information was pulled from here . It has been slightly modified. Messages Received Messages that Razor will process (WM_USER = 0x0400 or 1024) Request Data (WM_USER+200) This is used to register your application with Razor. Once your application is registered Razor will begin sending your application the messages described below. Parameters: WPARAM = The window handle where you want messages sent. LPARAM = flags ( 1 = get house notifications, NOTE all notification with a lesser notify value than the house notification will go to all windows that have requested information) Returns 2 on unhook, 1 on success, 0 on failure (failure means all slots full) . Notes: If you have registered a window and wish to unregister just send the message with the window handle again. Count Resources (WM_USER+201) This will prompt Razor to begin counting resources. Parameters: NONE Returns 1 on successful start or 0 on stop. Notes: If resources are already being counted the count will be stopped. UPDATE 7/13/99: currently it will always return 0 - this MAY be changed in the future but for now it will be zero Get Coords (WM_USER+202) Gets the current location of the character. Parameters: NONE Returns: X in the loword and Y in the hiword. (x=LOWORD(retVal); y=HIWORD(retVal);) Notes: You MUST use SendMessage for the return value to be valid. Get Skill (WM_USER+203) Gets the current skill level of specified skill. Parameters: WPARAM = skill number ( 0 based ) LPARAM (when 0 the return will be the 'display' value, when 1 it will be the 'base' value, 2 = get lock value, 3 = get skill name ). Returns: Skill level * 10. Meaning if the skill level was 19.4 you would get 194 returned. Or if lock value was requested the return is 0 = up, 1 = down, 2 = locked. If the skill name is requested the value is a global atom that you will need to free. Notes: You MUST use SendMessage for the return value to be valid. Get Stat (WM_USER+204) Gets the stat and its related attribute. Parameters: WPARAM = stat to get (str = 0, int = 1, dex = 2, weight = 3, 4 = Max HP, 5 = tithing points) Returns: Requested stat (str,int,dex, weight, max hp) in the loword and (hp,mana,stam, max weight, current hp) in hiword. You MUST use SendMessage for the return value to be valid. Set Active Macro (WM_USER + 205) NOTE: This is not enabled in Razor Sets the active macro Parameters: WPARAM = macro (zero based 0-7) Play macro (WM_USER+206) Plays/Stops active macro Parameters: None Returns: 0 - macro stopped 1 - macro playing Display text (WM_USER+207) Displays text on the game screen Parameters: WPARAM loword = color hiword = (0- over characters head 1- system message) LPARAM = global atom that contains string - Razor frees the atom after using it (See Windows SDK on ATOMS) Returns 0 - failure either the user isn't logged in or the atom wasn't found, 1 - success NOTE: Razor will only read strings 255 characters or less, I didn't actually test to see if uo can handle strings that long so if you plan to use long strings you should test that out first. Request house/boat information (WM_USER+208) Requests the information on house(s)/boat(s) in the nearby area. Parameters: None Returns: 0 - failure (not logged into game) 1 - success NOTE: You should make sure you are set to receive updates from Razor first. Add command line command (WM_USER+209) Add a command line command to Razor. When the user types the command (prefix is '-') you can receive a notification and the parameters the user enters using this feature. For example if you add the command 'broadcast' and the user types in '-broadcast run away' your window will receive a message with 'run away' as the parameters (in a global ATOM). Parameters: WPARAM - HWND of the window to receive the message. LPARAM - ATOM of the command (NOTE: spaces won't work correct) Returns On failure 0 - All command space has been used, 1 - the command ATOM was not found (must be a global atom) On success - returns the value of the message your window will receive (should be >= WM_USER + 400). The message you will receive will be like this: MessageID = return value from add call (remember to use SendMessage) WPARAM = NULL - either a global atom couldn't be create or no parameters were entered or a global ATOM that contains the parameters (You must delete the ATOM yourself)(See Windows SDK on ATOMS) NOTE: Commands are not case sensitive. If you add a command '/command' the user will have to type -/command in order for you to get the message. To remove a command send the command again with a zero as the WPARAM. Get User ID (WM_USER+210) You must use send message on this one. It returns a ID that Razor can use to identify the user (NOTE: it is not the actual user ID used by the servers). This is used to add a player to your party. Returns 0 if no user is logged in or a value if a user is logged into the game. Get Shard Name (WM_USER+211) Returns 0 if no user is logged into the game or if a global atom could not be created. Returns a global atom with the shard name in it. You must use SendMessage for this message. Add user to party (WM_USER+212) Parameters: WPARAM - User ID obtained from Get User ID message. Returns 0 on success, 1 on error (will not work if a macro is playing) You must use send message if you want the return value. Get UO window handle (WM_USER + 213) Parameters: None Returns the HWND of the UO window. NOTE - you must use SendMessage to get the correct value. Get poison status (WM_USER + 214) Parameters: None Returns 1 if poisoned or 0 if not poisoned. NOTE - you must use SendMessage to get the correct value. Set skill lock (WM_USER + 215) Parameters: WPARAM = zero based skill number, LPARAM = lock direction [0 = up, 1 = down, 2 = locked] Returns 0 on success, 1 on failure (will fail with invalid param(s) or not logged into game). NOTE: when the lock value is set Razor requests the current skill values from the server. So don't set locks in rapid succession for a long period of time or you may lag yourself out. Get account identifier (WM_USER + 216) Parameters: None currently Returns 0 if no character is logged into game otherwise a identifier for the account Messages Sent Messages Razor will send to apps that have registered a valid window. Resource Count Finished (WM_USER+301) This message is sent when resource counting has finished. Parameters : WPARAM is defined below and LPARAM is the count BloodMoss = 1 BlackPearl = 2 Garlic = 3 Ginseng = 4 Mandrake Root = 5 NightShade = 6 Sulfurous Ash = 7 Spider Silk = 8 User1 = 9 User2 = 10 User3 = 11 User4 = 12 User5 = 13 User6 = 14 Batwing = 100 DaemonBlood = 101 GraveDust = 102 NoxCrystal = 103 PigIron = 104 Tithing = 200 Spell was attempted (WM_USER+302) This message is sent when a spell is attempted. It is not known if the spell will fail or timeout or be cancelled. Parameters: WPARAM is the spell being cast (1 based) Logon (WM_USER+303) Sent when a character logs into the game Parameters: WPARAM is a character identifier (number value).
