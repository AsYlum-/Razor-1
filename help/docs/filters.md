    * Allow you to block the client from playing certain sounds.
* **Light Filter**
    * Force the client to always display 100% light levels
* **Death Filter**
    * Prevent the "You are dead" animation from playing
* **Filter dragons**
    * Override the dragon graphic and replace it with something else.
* **Filter drakes**
    * Override the drake graphic and replace it with something else.
* **Filter daemons**
    * Override the daemon graphic and replace it with something else.
